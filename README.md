# ToDoApp

An Application created as a part of [devChallenges Challenge 4](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/hH6PbOHBdPm6otzw2De5)

## Challenge

Create a todo app following the given designs. Use Front-end libraries like React or Vue.

Fulfill user stories below:

- User story: I can add a new task
- User story: I can complete a task
- User story: I can toggle between All, Active and Completed
- User story: I can remove one or all tasks under the Completed tab
- User story (optional): Store the data in local storage that when I refresh the page I can still see my progress

## Solution

Find the site in action [here](https://brave-bassi-231eac.netlify.app/)!

### Note:

- Stores the data on local storage so that progress is retained on refresh
- Initially no tasks will be found, start adding tasks to use the App
- The "delete all" button will only be visible if completed tasks are present
